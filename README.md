# CodeClauseInternship_ChurnPrediction
I worked on Churn prediction using logistic regression which is a valuable tool for telecom companies to proactively retain customers and reduce revenue loss due to churn. Churn prediction in the telecom industry using logistic regression is a common application of machine learning. Churn prediction refers to the task of identifying customers who are likely to switch to a different telecom service provider. Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm that can be used for this purpose.Churn prediction using logistic regression in Python is given as below:
Gather historical customer data and prepare it for analysis by addressing missing values and encoding features.
Explore the dataset to gain insights and visualize patterns to understand factors affecting churn.
Divide the data into a training set for model training and a testing set for evaluation.
Implement a logistic regression model, a binary classification algorithm, to predict churn.
Train the logistic regression model on the training data to learn patterns and relationships between features and churn.
Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve on the testing data.
Analyze model coefficients to identify influential features that impact churn positively or negatively.
Use insights from the model to develop strategies for customer retention, such as addressing factors strongly associated with churn.
Deploy the trained model in a production environment to make real-time predictions.
Continuously monitor the model's performance, retrain it with new data periodically, and adapt strategies to maintain customer retention and business growth.
Churn prediction with logistic regression empowers telecom companies to proactively identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling them to take targeted actions to retain customers and minimize revenue loss.
